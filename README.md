# wordle-clone

This is my follow along to WebDevSimplifieds YouTube video "wordle clone" built in vanilla JS.

As with everything, this is about practice and exposure (to ideas, methods and approaches) that help me become better at understanding and coding JavaScript using fun and engaging examples.

Once completed (matched with the video) I intend to create my own version using additional paramenters to test my knowledge and understabding of both the code and the process.
